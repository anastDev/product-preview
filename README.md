## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Bootstrap

### What I learned

I have learned how to effectively use Bootstrap classes to quickly style my components within the HTML code. Some of the key elements I styled include:

	•	Card layout: Used Bootstrap’s row and col classes to structure the layout, making the image and content align properly.
	•	Button styling: Applied Bootstrap’s btn class and customized it with additional properties for hover and active states.
	•	Responsiveness: Implemented Bootstrap’s grid system and media queries to ensure the layout adapts for smaller screen sizes (375px and below).

### Continued development

I did face some challenges during development, particularly in:

	•	Deciding where to focus more on Bootstrap’s predefined classes versus custom styling.
	•	Handling the media queries and ensuring the layout adjusts well for smaller screens. This required fine-tuning and close attention to detail.

In future projects, I’d like to improve my understanding of Bootstrap’s more advanced components and make my development process more efficient.
